-- 1)-Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

-- Query 1; 


SELECT 
  film_title, 
  name, 
  Count(film_title) AS rental_count 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      f.title AS film_title, 
      cat.name 
    FROM 
      film f 
      JOIN film_category f_cat ON f_cat.film_id = f.film_id 
      JOIN category cat ON cat.category_id = f_cat.category_id 
      JOIN inventory i ON i.film_id = f.film_id 
      JOIN rental ren ON ren.inventory_id = i.inventory_id 
    WHERE 
      cat.name IN (
        'Children', 'Classic', 'Comedy', 'Family', 
        'Music', 'Animation'
      )
  ) t1 
GROUP BY 
  1, 
  2 
ORDER BY 
  2, 
  1;





-- 2)-Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? 

--Query 2;


SELECT 
  film.title, 
  cat.name, 
  film.rental_duration, 
  NTILE(4) OVER (
    ORDER BY 
      film.rental_duration
  ) AS standard_quartile 
FROM 
  film_category f_cat 
  JOIN category cat ON cat.category_id = f_cat.category_id 
  join film film on film.film_id = f_cat.film_id 
WHERE 
  cat.name IN (
    'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 
    'Family', 'Music', 'Animation'
  ) 
ORDER BY 
  3;





-- 3)-Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:

-- Query 3;

SELECT 
  name, 
  standard_quartile, 
  COUNT(standard_quartile) 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      film.title, 
      cat.name, 
      film.rental_duration, 
      Ntile(4) OVER (
        ORDER BY 
          film.rental_duration
      ) AS standard_quartile 
    FROM 
      film_category f_cat 
      JOIN category cat ON cat.category_id = f_cat.category_id 
      JOIN film film ON film.film_id = f_cat.film_id 
    WHERE 
      cat.name IN (
        'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 
        'Family', 'Music', 'Animation'
      )
  ) AS tab 
GROUP BY 
  1, 
  2 
ORDER BY 
  1, 
  2;


-- 4)-Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.



--Query 4;

SELECT 
  DATE_PART('Month', rel.rental_date) AS rental_month, 
  DATE_PART('Year', rel.rental_date) AS rental_year, 
  s.store_id, 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM 
  rental rel 
  JOIN payment p ON p.rental_id = rel.rental_id 
  JOIN staff st ON st.staff_id = p.staff_id 
  JOIN store s ON s.store_id = st.store_id 
GROUP BY 
  1, 
  2, 
  3 
ORDER BY 
  4 DESC;
